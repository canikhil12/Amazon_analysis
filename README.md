# Amazon Analysis Project

This repository contains data analysis and visualization scripts for Amazon reviews. It is based on the notebook file **Amazon_analysis_Shan_Singh_Udemy.ipynb**.

## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze Amazon product reviews to uncover trends, insights, and patterns. This includes cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Key Features
### Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values, duplicates, and noisy data.
- Generates a clean, structured dataset for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Unveils patterns in review scores, sentiments, and customer feedback.
- Visualizes trends in ratings and review volumes.

### Statistical Analysis:
- Identifies key product categories and customer behavior insights.

### Visualization:
- Generates plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for clarity and impact.

### Machine Learning (Optional):
- Implements basic ML models for sentiment analysis or review classification.

## File Structure
- **Amazon_analysis_Shan_Singh_Udemy.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **Reviews.csv**: Dataset with Amazon review data.
- **Reviews_small.csv**: Reduced sample of the dataset (1000 rows).
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Technologies Used
### Python Libraries:
- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `numpy` - Numerical computations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning (if applicable)

### Tools:
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## Setup and Installation
### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/canikhil12/Amazon_analysis
cd amazon-analysis
```

### Install Dependencies:
Use `pip` to install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Run the Notebook:
- Open `Amazon_analysis_Shan_Singh_Udemy.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Run all cells to generate outputs.

## Data
The **Reviews.csv** dataset contains:
- **Review Texts**: User feedback.
- **Ratings**: Numerical ratings (1â€“5 stars).
- **Additional Columns**: Product categories, timestamps, and user info.

## Usage
1. Load the data into Jupyter Notebook.
2. Perform analysis to:
   - Find trends in ratings.
   - Visualize review sentiments.
3. Extend the project by adding ML models for classification or clustering.
